Instructions: Use arrow keys for moving your car. The score counter increases as time passes and the speed increases as well. Don't bump into other cars and try to set a high score!

Challenges we ran into: Plenty to mention :D

Accomplishments that we're proud of: Learning PyGame and Game Development

What we learned: PyGame and how difficult it is to create even a simple game, also, teamwork!
